Hey, twig!

2
00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:03.964 line:16 position:50% align:middle size:30%
Come here.

3
00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:05.673 line:16 position:50% align:middle size:30%
Come on.

5
00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:14.878 line:16 position:25% align:middle size:46%
what did they do to you?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:17.215
*drip*
6
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.439
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

7
00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.482
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

8
00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:28.684
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

9
00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:30.477
the thing I wore on my head.

10
00:00:31.205 --> 00:00:35.244
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

11
00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:36.719
You got it?

12
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:11.964
That's my underwears.

13
00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.341
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.





14
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:16.356
You have to explain it more careful.

15
00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:21.315
It's a prototype fin.

16
00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:29.558
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

17
00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:31.317
You explain it this time.

18
00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:34.004
All right.

19
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.722
That's Vorker's eye.

20
00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:38.876
He takes it out when he sleeps.

21
00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:40.398
Go. Look again.

22
00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:41.964
But leave the eye here.

23
00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:43.440
Why?

24
00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:44.958
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

25
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:47.520
and he's not gonna know...

26
00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:49.915
where his eye is!

27
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:57.683
That's a desk.

28
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.558
We told you it was this big.

29
00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.720
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

30
00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:11.604
with a bunch of severed human toes.

31
00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:15.360
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

32
00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:22.320
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

33
00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:23.838
Okay?

34
00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.242
What? No!

35
00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:35.661
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

36
00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:37.004
That's not what I said!

37
00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.165
I am Groot.

38
00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:39.421
He's relieved you don't want him to.

39
00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:40.924
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

40
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:41.756
I am Groot.

41
00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:43.114
On anyone, not just himself.

42
00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:44.115
I am Groot.

43
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.261
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

44
00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:49.141
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

45
00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:50.439
That's why you don't like hats?

46
00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:53.920
This is an important conversation
right now?

47
00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:31.645
That ain't it.

48
00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:42.998
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

49
00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:47.876
They killed all my friends.

50
00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:54.439
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

51
00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:02.165
One more thing.

52
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:06.314
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?
