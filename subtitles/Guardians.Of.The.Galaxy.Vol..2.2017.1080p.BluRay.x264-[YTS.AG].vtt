WEBVTT

00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:11.194
<i>There's a girl in this harbor town</i>

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:14.323
<i>And she works layin' whiskey down</i>

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:18.833
<i>They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"</i>

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.963
<i>And she serves them whiskey and wine</i>

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:26.164
<i>The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"</i>

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:30.113
<i>"What a good wife you would be"</i>

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:43.122
Come on!
Slow down!

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.196
This way, my river lily! Come on!

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:49.154
Where are you taking me?

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:50.325
Come on, come on.

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:52.676
Look. Look!

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:54.841
Oh, it's beautiful!

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:56.996
I was afraid it wouldn't
take to the soil...

00:01:57.205 --> 00:01:58.479
but it rooted quickly.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.245
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:04.477
All across the universe.

00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:07.836
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:09.597
but I like the way you say it.

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:11.444
My heart is yours...

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.157
Meredith Quill.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.675
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:13.441
Showtime, a-holes!

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.394
It will be here any minute.

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:18.317
Which will be its loss.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:19.924
I thought your thing was a sword?

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.245
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:25.085
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:27.325
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.084
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:33.601
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:35.073
It hurts.

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:36.245
It hurts?

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.438
I have sensitive nipples.

00:03:40.645 --> 00:03:43.284
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:45.003
What about him? What's he doing?

00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:47.719
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:49.113
How is that a priority?

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:51.640
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:53.397
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:54.964
That's hardly important right now.

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.400
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:00.478
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:04.115
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.323
I can clearly see you winking.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.716
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

00:04:14.845 --> 00:04:16.119
I am Groot.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.885
They were not looking at you funny.

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:24.757
Well, that's intense.

00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:28.165
Groot!

00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:45.874
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.045
Hi.

00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:31.760
No! Spit it out!

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:33.074
Come on!

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:37.484
Disgusting!

00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:41.998
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.197
I must cut through it from the inside.

00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:45.485
Huh?

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.999
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:49.165
Drax!

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.164
What is he doing?

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:03.086
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:05.181
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:07.861
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:09.443
I realize that.

00:08:13.205 --> 00:08:15.355
There is a cut on its neck.

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:17.755
Rocket, get it to look up.

00:08:20.005 --> 00:08:22.678
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:33.044
Watch it, Quill!

00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:21.796
Yes! I have single-handedly...

00:09:22.885 --> 00:09:24.525
vanquished the beast!

00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:28.314
What?

00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:39.678
What are they called again?

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.479
Anulax batteries.

00:09:41.805 --> 00:09:44.000
Harbulary batteries.

00:09:44.165 --> 00:09:46.474
That's nothing like what I just said.

00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:48.445
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

00:09:48.485 --> 00:09:50.525
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:54.160
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.

00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:55.957
The cost of transgression is death.

00:09:57.485 --> 00:10:01.444
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

00:10:01.605 --> 00:10:05.598
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:10.199
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.602
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:16.035
We control the DNA of our progeny...

00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:18.320
germinating them in birthing pods.

00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:22.115
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:25.765
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:29.476
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:31.636
For academic purposes.

00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:33.722
I would be honored, yes.

00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:35.876
In the name of research...

00:10:36.045 --> 00:10:38.559
I think that could be pretty, uh...

00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:39.999
repulsive.

00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:42.205
I'm not into that kind of casual...

00:10:42.445 --> 00:10:43.480
Oh, please.

00:10:43.645 --> 00:10:46.955
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.399
Bring it...

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.203
and we shall gladly be on our way.

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:06.559
Family reunion. Yay.

00:11:06.725 --> 00:11:09.159
I understand she is your sister.

00:11:09.325 --> 00:11:13.523
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

00:11:14.005 --> 00:11:18.157
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:21.082
Do with her as you please.

00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:26.402
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:29.365
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:34.044
My mother is from Earth.

00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:36.123
And your father?

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:40.757
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:42.244
I see it within you.

00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:45.957
An unorthodox genealogy.

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:50.363
A hybrid that seems particularly...

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:52.924
reckless.

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.997
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

00:11:58.365 --> 00:12:00.435
but that isn't true at all.

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:05.765
Oh, shit.

00:12:05.885 --> 00:12:07.921
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:10.355
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

00:12:12.485 --> 00:12:14.205
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

00:12:14.285 --> 00:12:16.037
You're telling me.

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:18.400
You wanna buy some batteries?

00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:32.553
<i>All right,
let's get baldy to Xandar</i>

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:34.078
<i>and collect that bounty.</i>

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:28.361
That stuff about my father...

00:13:28.645 --> 00:13:30.636
Who does she think she is?

00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:33.114
I know you're sensitive about that.

00:13:33.285 --> 00:13:35.485
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

00:13:37.165 --> 00:13:40.043
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:41.878
I wasn't.

00:13:42.085 --> 00:13:44.155
I don't care if you were.

00:13:44.325 --> 00:13:46.122
Well, I feel like you do care.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.515
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

00:13:48.845 --> 00:13:50.915
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:52.960
Damn shadow.

00:13:53.245 --> 00:13:55.156
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:56.997
those who dance, and those who do not.

00:13:57.405 --> 00:13:59.043
Mmm-hmm.

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:01.396
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:02.565
Oh, God.

00:14:02.645 --> 00:14:05.478
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:07.203
Except one woman.

00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:08.998
My Ovette.

00:14:09.805 --> 00:14:11.841
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

00:14:12.165 --> 00:14:14.599
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

00:14:15.245 --> 00:14:17.520
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:20.481
Wouldn't move a muscle.

00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:23.364
One might assume she was dead.

00:14:23.525 --> 00:14:24.924
That does sound pretty hot.

00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:28.164
It would make
my nether regions engorge.

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.202
Okay. I get it, yes.

00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:32.276
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

00:14:32.445 --> 00:14:35.881
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:38.205
Mmm.

00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:44.118
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:45.758
No. It's not ripe yet...

00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:46.960
and I hate you.

00:14:47.205 --> 00:14:48.433
You hate me?

00:14:48.605 --> 00:14:51.324
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

00:14:51.485 --> 00:14:53.555
And yet here you stand, a hero.

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:56.518
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:58.279
I swear.

00:14:58.445 --> 00:14:59.560
No.

00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:01.522
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

00:15:01.605 --> 00:15:03.118
in a prison on Xandar...

00:15:03.285 --> 00:15:04.604
wishing you could.

00:15:11.565 --> 00:15:12.634
This is weird.

00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:14.661
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

00:15:14.685 --> 00:15:15.821
Why would they do that?

00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:17.461
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:18.485
Dude!

00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:20.005
Right.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.285
He didn't steal some of those.

00:15:21.325 --> 00:15:23.261
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:36.156
What were you thinking?

00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:37.701
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:39.158
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

00:15:39.325 --> 00:15:41.600
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:43.483
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:46.879
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:49.541
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.245
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.077
I was being sarcastic!

00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:54.314
Oh, no!

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:55.661
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!

00:15:55.685 --> 00:15:56.720
Now I look foolish!

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.501
Can we put the bickering on hold...

00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:00.561
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

00:16:00.845 --> 00:16:02.483
More incoming!
Good!

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.124
I wanna kill some guys!

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.365
You're not killing anyone.

00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:15.038
All those ships are remotely piloted.

00:16:18.565 --> 00:16:19.565
Damn it!

00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:32.116
What is the delay, Admiral?

00:16:32.285 --> 00:16:36.358
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:37.821
and could destroy the entire fleet.

00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:40.564
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:44.402
We hired them and they steal from us.

00:16:45.525 --> 00:16:46.885
It is heresy of the highest order.

00:16:48.885 --> 00:16:50.876
<i>All command modules...</i>

00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:53.639
<i>fire with the intent to kill.</i>

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:04.763
What's the nearest habitable planet?

00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:07.118
It's called Berhert.

00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:09.003
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:12.157
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

00:17:12.325 --> 00:17:15.158
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:26.005
Quill, to make it through that...

00:17:26.085 --> 00:17:27.781
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

00:17:27.805 --> 00:17:28.840
Lucky for us, I...

00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:30.438
I am.

00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:43.961
What are you doing?

00:17:44.245 --> 00:17:46.285
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:49.357
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

00:17:49.525 --> 00:17:52.278
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:53.805
Stop it.

00:17:53.925 --> 00:17:55.781
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:57.941
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.

00:17:57.965 --> 00:17:59.381
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

00:17:59.405 --> 00:18:01.285
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.035
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:06.764
Oh, it won't be my turd.

00:18:06.925 --> 00:18:08.278
It will be Drax's.

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:12.597
I have famously huge turds.

00:18:12.885 --> 00:18:15.479
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:18.965
Son of a...

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:20.564
Dude! Seriously!

00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:22.165
Hey! Let me...

00:18:36.605 --> 00:18:37.879
Idiots!

00:18:38.125 --> 00:18:39.125
Well, that's what you get

00:18:39.165 --> 00:18:40.598
when Quill flies.

00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:42.238
Ow!

00:18:42.485 --> 00:18:44.680
We still have a Sovereign craft
behind us.

00:18:47.605 --> 00:18:49.436
Our weapons are down.

00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:51.675
20 clicks to the jump!

00:18:54.685 --> 00:18:55.685
Hold on.

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:08.081
It's not ripe.

00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:18.155
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:23.357
Yes!

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:26.556
15 clicks to the jump!

00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:28.160
Come on!

00:19:28.965 --> 00:19:30.444
Keep going!

00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:45.880
10 clicks!

00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:51.283
Die, spaceship!

00:19:56.085 --> 00:19:57.359
You suck, Zylak.

00:19:57.525 --> 00:19:58.560
Typical.

00:20:01.245 --> 00:20:02.245
Five clicks!

00:20:08.085 --> 00:20:09.598
Son of a...

00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:11.876
They went around the field!

00:20:26.245 --> 00:20:28.440
Someone destroyed all our ships!

00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:29.833
What?

00:20:32.725 --> 00:20:34.522
Who?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:36.998
One click!

00:20:38.165 --> 00:20:39.962
- What is that?
- Who cares?

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:41.399
That's the jump point! Go!

00:20:45.165 --> 00:20:46.883
It's a guy.

00:20:54.005 --> 00:20:54.835
Oh, my God.

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.438
He's still out there?

00:21:23.525 --> 00:21:25.755
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

00:21:26.645 --> 00:21:28.840
Prepare for a really bad landing!

00:22:09.525 --> 00:22:11.481
That was awesome!

00:22:12.805 --> 00:22:13.874
Yes!

00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:17.319
Look at this!

00:22:18.085 --> 00:22:19.677
Where is the other half of our ship?

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:20.845
My ship.

00:22:21.005 --> 00:22:24.714
Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...

00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.101
had you flown with
what's between your ears

00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:27.604
instead of what's between your legs!

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:31.118
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

00:22:31.285 --> 00:22:33.401
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

00:22:34.485 --> 00:22:36.365
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

00:22:36.885 --> 00:22:38.045
More like because he stole...

00:22:38.205 --> 00:22:39.274
the Anulax batteries!

00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:41.720
They're called Harbulary batteries.

00:22:41.925 --> 00:22:43.517
No, they're not!

00:22:43.685 --> 00:22:45.357
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?

00:22:46.165 --> 00:22:47.645
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

00:22:47.765 --> 00:22:49.676
I did it because I wanted to!

00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:50.482
Dick.

00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:52.562
What are we even talking about this for?

00:22:52.725 --> 00:22:55.193
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:56.365
How little?

00:22:56.405 --> 00:22:58.600
Well, I don't know, like this?

00:22:58.805 --> 00:23:00.443
A little one-inch man saved us?

00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:02.845
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

00:23:02.925 --> 00:23:05.280
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

00:23:05.445 --> 00:23:06.764
Don't call me a raccoon!

00:23:07.165 --> 00:23:09.599
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

00:23:10.445 --> 00:23:11.719
I meant trash panda.

00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:15.279
Is that better?

00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:17.517
I don't know.

00:23:17.685 --> 00:23:19.915
It's worse. It's so much worse.

00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:21.313
You son of a...

00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:22.201
Hey!

00:23:22.365 --> 00:23:23.861
I've had it with you!
No! Back up!

00:23:23.885 --> 00:23:25.925
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:29.840
Set me free, you'll need my help.

00:23:30.005 --> 00:23:31.120
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:33.301
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

00:23:33.325 --> 00:23:34.661
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

00:23:34.685 --> 00:23:35.685
No, I won't.

00:23:35.845 --> 00:23:39.121
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:41.241
I bet it's the one-inch man.

00:24:13.165 --> 00:24:16.840
After all these years, I've found you.

00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:19.323
And who the hell are you?

00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:23.436
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:26.835
My name is Ego...

00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:29.604
and I'm your dad, Peter.

00:24:46.085 --> 00:24:47.645
You know what they say...

00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:50.683
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

00:25:17.485 --> 00:25:18.884
Yondu!

00:25:19.605 --> 00:25:21.561
Come on down!

00:25:33.245 --> 00:25:35.361
After going around
years in circles...

00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:37.402
with this woman I end up marrying.

00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:40.244
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:41.838
"but you're losing your mind!"

00:25:42.005 --> 00:25:43.961
Then again, she's always been that way.

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:45.922
I could never trust her. You know?

00:25:46.085 --> 00:25:47.085
Stakar.

00:25:51.325 --> 00:25:53.043
It's been some time.

00:25:57.165 --> 00:26:01.158
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

00:26:07.205 --> 00:26:08.205
- Sir!
- Stakar!

00:26:08.365 --> 00:26:10.754
There's a hundred
Ravager factions.

00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:13.923
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:15.598
Please, sir. Please!

00:26:15.805 --> 00:26:17.033
Get away from me.

00:26:22.445 --> 00:26:25.278
You can go to hell then!

00:26:25.485 --> 00:26:27.601
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:29.802
So what are you following us for?

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.461
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:32.918
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

00:26:33.005 --> 00:26:34.324
You betrayed the code!

00:26:34.485 --> 00:26:36.316
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:39.318
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

00:26:39.485 --> 00:26:40.485
You didn't know because

00:26:40.525 --> 00:26:42.181
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.

00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:44.355
I demand a seat at the table!

00:26:44.445 --> 00:26:46.515
I wear these flames, same as you.

00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:48.755
You may dress like us...

00:26:48.965 --> 00:26:51.445
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

00:26:51.605 --> 00:26:53.402
And the Colors of Ogord...

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:56.955
will never flash over your grave.

00:26:58.325 --> 00:26:59.644
If you think...

00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:03.996
I take pleasure in exiling you...

00:27:05.725 --> 00:27:07.363
you're wrong.

00:27:08.645 --> 00:27:11.523
You broke all our hearts.

00:27:26.205 --> 00:27:28.514
Ah, pathetic.

00:27:29.645 --> 00:27:31.636
First, Quill betrays us...

00:27:31.805 --> 00:27:35.081
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

00:27:36.005 --> 00:27:38.394
We followed him
because he was the one...

00:27:38.565 --> 00:27:40.999
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

00:27:41.205 --> 00:27:43.435
Seems he's goin' soft.

00:27:44.045 --> 00:27:46.434
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

00:27:47.085 --> 00:27:48.882
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

00:27:49.045 --> 00:27:53.436
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

00:27:53.645 --> 00:27:55.203
Who the hell is that?

00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:36.917
Yondu Udonta...

00:28:37.605 --> 00:28:39.755
I have a proposition for you.

00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:42.361
<i>I hired Yondu to pick you up...</i>

00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:44.641
when your mother passed away.

00:28:44.805 --> 00:28:46.602
But instead of returning you...

00:28:46.805 --> 00:28:48.602
Yondu kept you.

00:28:48.765 --> 00:28:51.359
I have no clue as to why.

00:28:52.445 --> 00:28:53.958
Well, I'll tell you why.

00:28:54.125 --> 00:28:55.524
Because I was a skinny little kid

00:28:55.605 --> 00:28:57.261
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.

00:28:57.285 --> 00:28:58.798
It made it easier for thievin'.

00:28:58.965 --> 00:29:02.241
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:04.501
I thought Yondu was your father.

00:29:04.525 --> 00:29:06.595
What? We've been together
this whole time...

00:29:06.765 --> 00:29:09.563
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

00:29:09.725 --> 00:29:10.953
You look exactly alike.

00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:12.763
One's blue!

00:29:14.405 --> 00:29:16.043
No, he's not my father!

00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:18.673
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

00:29:18.845 --> 00:29:20.781
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

00:29:20.805 --> 00:29:22.796
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

00:29:22.965 --> 00:29:24.318
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

00:29:24.485 --> 00:29:26.476
Oh, that son of a bitch.

00:29:26.645 --> 00:29:27.998
How'd you locate us now?

00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:31.797
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

00:29:32.005 --> 00:29:34.394
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:36.954
What say we head out there right now?

00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:39.765
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:41.833
I promise you...

00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:44.316
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:46.314
And there...

00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:50.480
I can explain your very special heritage.

00:29:51.805 --> 00:29:53.636
Finally get to be...

00:29:53.805 --> 00:29:56.524
the father I've always wanted to be.

00:29:57.965 --> 00:29:59.478
Excuse me.

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:01.364
I've gotta take a whiz.

00:30:07.525 --> 00:30:09.243
I'm not buying it.

00:30:11.485 --> 00:30:13.157
Let's go take a walk.

00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:21.364
I am Mantis.

00:30:25.205 --> 00:30:26.524
What are you doing?

00:30:26.845 --> 00:30:28.198
Smiling.

00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:31.479
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

00:30:32.645 --> 00:30:34.715
Not if you do it like that.

00:30:35.205 --> 00:30:36.240
Oh...

00:30:36.325 --> 00:30:38.885
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:43.755
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

00:30:46.205 --> 00:30:49.800
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

00:30:52.645 --> 00:30:53.680
Yes.

00:31:02.925 --> 00:31:06.600
That is called a practical joke!

00:31:09.925 --> 00:31:11.916
I liked it very much!

00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:13.757
I just made it up!

00:31:16.605 --> 00:31:17.605
Give me a break!

00:31:18.525 --> 00:31:19.525
After all this time,

00:31:19.605 --> 00:31:21.061
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...

00:31:21.085 --> 00:31:22.882
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

00:31:22.965 --> 00:31:25.115
And by the way,
this could be a trap.

00:31:25.205 --> 00:31:26.843
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:28.677
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

00:31:28.765 --> 00:31:29.800
But what?

00:31:29.885 --> 00:31:32.274
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:33.400
Who?

00:31:33.565 --> 00:31:34.793
He owned a magic boat?

00:31:36.845 --> 00:31:38.119
David Hasselhoff?

00:31:38.285 --> 00:31:39.115
Right.

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:41.355
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:42.525
Why did he talk again?

00:31:42.685 --> 00:31:46.200
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:48.959
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:50.877
and you would tell
all the other children...

00:31:50.965 --> 00:31:53.195
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

00:31:53.285 --> 00:31:55.879
Shooting <i>Knight Rider</i>
or touring with his band in Germany.

00:31:55.965 --> 00:31:58.461
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

00:31:58.485 --> 00:31:59.554
I love that story.

00:31:59.645 --> 00:32:01.681
I hate that story.

00:32:01.765 --> 00:32:03.278
It's so sad!

00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:08.482
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

00:32:08.645 --> 00:32:11.318
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

00:32:12.085 --> 00:32:13.757
That's my point, Peter.

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:17.438
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

00:32:20.885 --> 00:32:22.318
If he ends up being evil...

00:32:23.805 --> 00:32:25.363
we will just kill him.

00:32:33.845 --> 00:32:35.125
You're leaving me with that fox?

00:32:35.165 --> 00:32:36.280
He's not a fox.

00:32:36.485 --> 00:32:38.521
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.961
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

00:32:43.285 --> 00:32:45.515
It'll be just a couple of days.

00:32:45.725 --> 00:32:48.523
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

00:32:51.765 --> 00:32:53.596
<i>What if the Sovereign come?</i>

00:32:53.765 --> 00:32:55.981
There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

00:32:56.005 --> 00:32:57.597
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

00:32:57.765 --> 00:32:59.357
God, you're like an old woman.

00:32:59.525 --> 00:33:01.197
Because I'm wise?

00:33:02.165 --> 00:33:04.121
Why do you have
so much luggage?

00:33:04.285 --> 00:33:06.435
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

00:33:09.525 --> 00:33:12.085
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

00:33:14.165 --> 00:33:17.919
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:20.875
Because it's working.

00:33:24.205 --> 00:33:29.518
<i>And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again</i>

00:33:30.565 --> 00:33:35.719
<i>I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain</i>

00:33:35.885 --> 00:33:38.877
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

00:33:39.085 --> 00:33:42.157
<i>You will never love me again</i>

00:33:42.325 --> 00:33:46.238
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

00:33:46.405 --> 00:33:48.396
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

00:33:48.565 --> 00:33:51.762
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

00:33:51.925 --> 00:33:54.564
<i>You will never love me again</i>

00:33:54.765 --> 00:33:57.757
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:01.315
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

00:34:08.365 --> 00:34:10.321
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

00:34:10.725 --> 00:34:11.725
Oh...

00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:14.440
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:16.364
Your antennae, what are they for?

00:34:17.045 --> 00:34:18.114
Their purpose?

00:34:18.285 --> 00:34:20.116
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

00:34:20.285 --> 00:34:22.355
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:24.440
I say...

00:34:24.605 --> 00:34:26.994
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:29.963
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:32.275
Right.
And if it's anything other than...

00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:35.835
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

00:34:36.005 --> 00:34:38.473
They are not for feeling doorways.

00:34:40.365 --> 00:34:41.365
I think...

00:34:41.565 --> 00:34:44.284
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

00:34:44.845 --> 00:34:45.845
What are those?

00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:49.515
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

00:34:50.685 --> 00:34:52.437
- You read minds?
- No.

00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:54.880
Telepaths know thoughts.

00:34:54.965 --> 00:34:57.479
Empaths feel feelings.

00:34:58.645 --> 00:34:59.645
Emotions.

00:35:02.325 --> 00:35:03.440
May I?

00:35:04.485 --> 00:35:05.998
All right.

00:35:14.325 --> 00:35:16.714
You feel love.

00:35:18.365 --> 00:35:21.357
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

00:35:21.525 --> 00:35:22.674
No!

00:35:22.845 --> 00:35:24.676
Romantic, sexual love.

00:35:24.965 --> 00:35:26.284
No, I don't.

00:35:26.485 --> 00:35:28.043
- For her!
- No!

00:35:31.525 --> 00:35:32.640
Okay.

00:35:35.685 --> 00:35:37.835
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:40.314
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

00:35:40.485 --> 00:35:41.804
You must be so embarrassed!

00:35:45.725 --> 00:35:47.522
Do me! Do me!

00:35:52.885 --> 00:35:55.843
I have never felt such humor!

00:35:59.365 --> 00:36:01.356
So unbelievably uncool.

00:36:02.725 --> 00:36:04.158
Oh, Quill.

00:36:06.525 --> 00:36:10.484
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

00:36:15.845 --> 00:36:19.474
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:20.645
Yeah, like what?

00:36:21.525 --> 00:36:24.642
If I touch someone who is sad...

00:36:24.805 --> 00:36:27.478
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:31.513
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

00:36:31.685 --> 00:36:34.722
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

00:36:34.925 --> 00:36:38.759
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

00:36:40.925 --> 00:36:42.074
Do one of those on me.

00:36:46.645 --> 00:36:48.237
Sleep.

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.645
I love this song.

00:38:12.245 --> 00:38:13.245
Huh?

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:15.719
There!

00:38:27.365 --> 00:38:28.365
Ah...

00:39:36.085 --> 00:39:38.679
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

00:39:38.845 --> 00:39:40.961
are you?

00:39:42.965 --> 00:39:44.000
Move!

00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:01.920
Crap.

00:40:07.525 --> 00:40:08.958
Hey there, rat!

00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:11.434
How's it going, you blue idiot?

00:40:11.965 --> 00:40:14.001
Not so bad.

00:40:14.165 --> 00:40:16.554
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

00:40:16.725 --> 00:40:19.558
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

00:40:19.725 --> 00:40:23.638
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...

00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:24.805
because she wants

00:40:24.845 --> 00:40:26.403
to kill y'all.

00:40:26.565 --> 00:40:27.793
Your friend...

00:40:27.965 --> 00:40:29.637
There's too many of them.

00:40:29.805 --> 00:40:33.002
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

00:40:33.205 --> 00:40:35.799
you need to get me out of these bonds.

00:40:36.405 --> 00:40:38.316
They are going to kill him!

00:40:38.485 --> 00:40:40.635
I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.

00:40:40.765 --> 00:40:42.721
I put a tracer on your ship back there...

00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:44.244
during the war over Xandar.

00:40:44.765 --> 00:40:47.154
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

00:40:47.325 --> 00:40:49.202
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

00:40:50.045 --> 00:40:52.434
Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.

00:40:52.925 --> 00:40:55.155
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

00:40:55.325 --> 00:40:56.678
Otherwise, you'd what?

00:40:57.885 --> 00:40:59.364
We'll take them batteries.

00:40:59.565 --> 00:41:03.001
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

00:41:03.165 --> 00:41:05.474
That Priestess offered us a million.

00:41:05.685 --> 00:41:08.404
A quarter is only one third of that!

00:41:08.565 --> 00:41:09.680
A quarter ain't a third.

00:41:09.845 --> 00:41:11.642
A quarter is 25.

00:41:11.805 --> 00:41:12.805
No.

00:41:12.965 --> 00:41:15.274
We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.

00:41:15.405 --> 00:41:16.440
Enough!

00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:21.440
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

00:41:21.845 --> 00:41:24.313
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

00:41:25.125 --> 00:41:27.036
That ain't right!

00:41:27.205 --> 00:41:30.242
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:32.714
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

00:41:32.885 --> 00:41:35.763
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!

00:41:35.925 --> 00:41:36.925
Yeah!

00:41:37.085 --> 00:41:38.598
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

00:41:38.765 --> 00:41:39.765
Take it easy, Kraglin.

00:41:39.885 --> 00:41:42.353
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

00:41:42.565 --> 00:41:45.602
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

00:41:50.725 --> 00:41:52.955
Put your damn guns down!

00:41:53.125 --> 00:41:54.399
Whoa! Whoa!

00:41:54.565 --> 00:41:58.001
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

00:41:58.205 --> 00:42:00.878
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

00:42:20.045 --> 00:42:21.717
Well, hello, boys.

00:42:27.405 --> 00:42:28.963
It's not ripe.

00:43:13.765 --> 00:43:17.235
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

00:43:17.325 --> 00:43:19.793
Wow.
You have your own planet?

00:43:19.885 --> 00:43:23.673
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

00:43:23.885 --> 00:43:25.398
Humility.

00:43:25.565 --> 00:43:26.964
I like it.

00:43:27.325 --> 00:43:29.680
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

00:44:12.205 --> 00:44:16.323
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:18.722
What are you exactly?

00:44:19.885 --> 00:44:23.116
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

00:44:24.525 --> 00:44:26.959
A Celestial, like a god?

00:44:28.205 --> 00:44:30.719
Mmm, small "g," son.

00:44:30.845 --> 00:44:33.678
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

00:44:45.005 --> 00:44:46.005
Whoa!

00:44:48.125 --> 00:44:51.435
I don't know where I came from exactly.

00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:53.561
First thing I remember is flickering...

00:44:54.205 --> 00:44:56.036
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

00:44:57.045 --> 00:44:59.479
and entirely alone.

00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:02.476
Over millions of years...

00:45:02.725 --> 00:45:06.240
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

00:45:06.605 --> 00:45:09.677
I grew smarter and stronger.

00:45:11.725 --> 00:45:14.683
And I continued building from there...

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.961
layer by layer...

00:45:17.125 --> 00:45:19.719
the very planet you walk on now.

00:45:19.885 --> 00:45:21.159
Whoa.

00:45:21.765 --> 00:45:22.914
But I wanted more.

00:45:24.165 --> 00:45:25.803
I desired...

00:45:26.285 --> 00:45:27.434
meaning.

00:45:28.645 --> 00:45:32.604
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

00:45:32.765 --> 00:45:35.518
"besides just me," I thought.

00:45:35.725 --> 00:45:39.718
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

00:45:40.085 --> 00:45:41.518
I created...

00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:45.314
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

00:45:45.485 --> 00:45:49.239
down to the most minute detail.

00:45:50.365 --> 00:45:51.718
Did you make a penis?

00:45:51.885 --> 00:45:53.079
Dude!

00:45:53.245 --> 00:45:54.473
What is wrong with you?

00:45:54.645 --> 00:45:57.637
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

00:45:57.805 --> 00:45:58.805
He would smush her!

00:46:01.045 --> 00:46:03.240
I don't need to hear how my parents...

00:46:04.485 --> 00:46:05.485
Why?

00:46:06.245 --> 00:46:07.837
My father would tell the story

00:46:07.925 --> 00:46:09.836
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

00:46:10.005 --> 00:46:11.438
That's disgusting.

00:46:11.605 --> 00:46:13.038
It was beautiful.

00:46:14.325 --> 00:46:15.804
You Earthers have hang-ups.

00:46:16.365 --> 00:46:18.435
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

00:46:18.685 --> 00:46:20.323
Ha! Thank you!

00:46:20.485 --> 00:46:21.600
It's not half bad.

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.198
- Oh.
- Ugh.

00:46:23.485 --> 00:46:27.000
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

00:46:27.165 --> 00:46:28.917
and all the accompanying junk.

00:46:29.405 --> 00:46:34.035
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

00:46:34.205 --> 00:46:37.197
as I set out amongst the stars...

00:46:37.885 --> 00:46:40.080
until I found...

00:46:40.245 --> 00:46:41.917
what I sought.

00:46:43.525 --> 00:46:44.674
Life.

00:46:46.405 --> 00:46:48.714
I was not alone in the universe after all.

00:46:55.525 --> 00:46:57.356
When did you meet my mother?

00:47:01.525 --> 00:47:03.197
Not long after.

00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:13.641
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

00:47:17.565 --> 00:47:20.716
I called her my river lily.

00:47:24.965 --> 00:47:27.479
And from that love, Peter...

00:47:31.125 --> 00:47:32.319
you.

00:47:39.605 --> 00:47:43.120
I have searched for you for so long.

00:47:44.725 --> 00:47:46.397
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

00:47:46.565 --> 00:47:50.319
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

00:47:52.085 --> 00:47:55.043
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

00:47:56.645 --> 00:47:59.034
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:22.002
This is mutiny!

00:48:22.765 --> 00:48:27.793
This is mutiny!

00:48:39.645 --> 00:48:40.998
You're scum!

00:48:44.645 --> 00:48:45.919
Oh!

00:49:16.525 --> 00:49:17.594
Captain!

00:49:17.765 --> 00:49:20.325
Help me! Please!

00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:22.038
Captain!

00:49:25.325 --> 00:49:26.997
You're the one what killed those men...

00:49:27.605 --> 00:49:29.402
by leading them down the wrong path.

00:49:30.365 --> 00:49:31.923
Because you're weak.

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:35.918
And stupid!

00:49:38.005 --> 00:49:40.041
It's time for the Ravagers...

00:49:40.205 --> 00:49:43.880
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

00:49:44.765 --> 00:49:46.403
Taserface!

00:49:54.125 --> 00:49:57.754
I'm sorry. Your name is...

00:49:57.925 --> 00:49:59.563
It's Taserface?

00:50:00.045 --> 00:50:01.364
That's right.

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:04.040
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

00:50:04.725 --> 00:50:06.522
It's metaphorical!

00:50:06.685 --> 00:50:07.685
Yeah!

00:50:11.285 --> 00:50:12.285
For what?

00:50:14.565 --> 00:50:17.159
For it is a name what strikes fear...

00:50:17.325 --> 00:50:20.078
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

00:50:22.765 --> 00:50:23.993
Okay.

00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:25.833
Okay...

00:50:26.045 --> 00:50:27.194
whatever you say.

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:29.044
You shut up.

00:50:29.205 --> 00:50:30.399
You're next.

00:50:30.725 --> 00:50:34.638
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:35.885
What?

00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:40.037
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

00:50:40.205 --> 00:50:43.242
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

00:50:43.405 --> 00:50:46.477
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:49.079
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

00:50:49.205 --> 00:50:51.514
"Taserface!"

00:50:52.605 --> 00:50:55.165
That's how I hear you in my head!

00:50:56.085 --> 00:50:58.235
What was your second choice?

00:50:58.405 --> 00:51:00.236
Scrotum Hat?

00:51:02.605 --> 00:51:05.165
New plan. We're killing you first.

00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:09.642
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

00:51:09.805 --> 00:51:13.798
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

00:51:13.965 --> 00:51:16.798
That's enough killing for today.

00:51:20.805 --> 00:51:22.443
She's the daughter
of Thanos.

00:51:24.685 --> 00:51:26.981
I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

00:51:27.005 --> 00:51:29.838
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

00:51:30.005 --> 00:51:33.634
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

00:51:33.805 --> 00:51:36.638
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

00:51:38.445 --> 00:51:39.798
I assure you...

00:51:39.965 --> 00:51:42.798
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:44.796
or a talking woodland beast.

00:51:46.205 --> 00:51:48.036
I want 10% of the take...

00:51:49.765 --> 00:51:51.483
and a couple more things.

00:51:53.325 --> 00:51:54.963
We got
a whole box of hands...

00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:56.956
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

00:51:57.125 --> 00:52:00.322
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

00:52:00.485 --> 00:52:04.717
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:08.321
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:10.163
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

00:52:10.325 --> 00:52:12.634
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

00:52:12.805 --> 00:52:14.921
What are you gonna do with your share?

00:52:15.845 --> 00:52:18.120
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

00:52:18.245 --> 00:52:20.042
battle one another in training.

00:52:20.845 --> 00:52:23.154
Every time my sister prevailed...

00:52:23.325 --> 00:52:26.635
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

00:52:26.805 --> 00:52:29.478
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

00:52:30.565 --> 00:52:32.396
But she won...

00:52:32.565 --> 00:52:37.400
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

00:52:39.045 --> 00:52:41.354
So after I murder my sister...

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.674
I will buy a warship

00:52:42.765 --> 00:52:44.756
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

00:52:44.925 --> 00:52:48.554
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

00:52:48.725 --> 00:52:50.158
piece by piece...

00:52:50.325 --> 00:52:53.715
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

00:52:53.885 --> 00:52:57.002
I know every single day.

00:52:58.885 --> 00:53:00.238
Yeah.

00:53:00.725 --> 00:53:02.485
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

00:53:03.285 --> 00:53:05.196
Or a nice hat.

00:53:05.365 --> 00:53:08.084
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

00:53:12.045 --> 00:53:15.242
Anyways, happy trails.

00:53:23.045 --> 00:53:26.481
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

00:53:28.245 --> 00:53:30.759
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.

00:53:30.925 --> 00:53:31.960
Peter...

00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:34.021
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

00:53:34.045 --> 00:53:35.444
But you left...

00:53:35.605 --> 00:53:38.403
the most wonderful woman ever...

00:53:38.605 --> 00:53:40.084
to die alone.

00:53:40.285 --> 00:53:43.675
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

00:53:43.845 --> 00:53:45.995
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

00:53:46.205 --> 00:53:47.558
and the light within it...

00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:49.283
this form will wither and perish.

00:53:49.445 --> 00:53:51.485
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

00:53:51.605 --> 00:53:53.516
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

00:53:53.965 --> 00:53:55.921
I loved your mother, Peter!

00:53:56.085 --> 00:53:58.440
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

00:53:58.605 --> 00:54:01.438
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:03.994
I know exactly what that feels like!

00:54:04.165 --> 00:54:05.917
I had to watch her die!

00:54:10.285 --> 00:54:14.437
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

00:54:14.605 --> 00:54:17.073
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

00:54:17.925 --> 00:54:20.120
But you're not one of them.

00:54:21.965 --> 00:54:25.674
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

00:54:30.965 --> 00:54:35.675
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

00:54:35.845 --> 00:54:37.517
and the light within.

00:54:37.965 --> 00:54:41.082
They are a part of you, Peter.

00:54:42.005 --> 00:54:43.597
What do you mean?

00:54:44.485 --> 00:54:46.316
Give me your hands, son.

00:54:47.325 --> 00:54:48.440
Here.

00:54:49.325 --> 00:54:51.202
Hold them like that.

00:54:57.125 --> 00:55:00.003
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

00:55:01.165 --> 00:55:04.123
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

00:55:09.045 --> 00:55:10.876
Yes!

00:55:11.325 --> 00:55:13.043
Whoa!

00:55:13.205 --> 00:55:14.558
Yes! It's okay.

00:55:14.725 --> 00:55:15.794
Just relax. Concentrate.

00:55:16.005 --> 00:55:18.075
You can do it. Bring it back.

00:55:18.645 --> 00:55:19.714
Yes!

00:55:21.365 --> 00:55:24.163
Yes, now shape it.

00:55:24.525 --> 00:55:26.197
Feel that energy.

00:55:30.365 --> 00:55:31.365
Yes.

00:55:35.685 --> 00:55:37.004
You're home.

00:55:39.565 --> 00:55:40.714
Peter...

00:56:15.245 --> 00:56:18.123
How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

00:56:18.765 --> 00:56:21.643
Ego found me
in my larva state.

00:56:21.805 --> 00:56:23.238
Orphaned on my homeworld.

00:56:24.205 --> 00:56:26.765
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

00:56:28.325 --> 00:56:29.644
So you're a pet?

00:56:30.925 --> 00:56:32.244
I suppose.

00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:36.120
People usually want cute pets.

00:56:36.285 --> 00:56:38.560
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

00:56:38.725 --> 00:56:40.044
I am hideous?

00:56:40.205 --> 00:56:42.355
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:46.600
But that's a good thing.

00:56:46.805 --> 00:56:47.805
Oh?

00:56:48.165 --> 00:56:49.837
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

00:56:49.925 --> 00:56:52.439
you know they love you for who you are.

00:56:53.805 --> 00:56:56.160
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

00:56:57.125 --> 00:56:59.958
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

00:57:01.485 --> 00:57:04.636
Those pools,
they remind me of a time...

00:57:04.805 --> 00:57:08.320
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

00:57:09.525 --> 00:57:10.799
She was like you.

00:57:11.285 --> 00:57:12.718
Disgusting?

00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:14.954
Innocent.

00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:49.165
Drax?

00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:52.477
There's something I must tell you.

00:58:00.965 --> 00:58:02.034
What's going on?

00:58:02.205 --> 00:58:04.082
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

00:58:04.245 --> 00:58:07.635
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

00:58:08.045 --> 00:58:09.558
You're not ugly. Drax!

00:58:09.725 --> 00:58:11.044
What are you talking about?

00:58:11.205 --> 00:58:12.354
Mantis...

00:58:12.885 --> 00:58:14.876
can you show us where we'll be staying?

00:58:15.485 --> 00:58:17.245
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

00:58:17.405 --> 00:58:19.475
The planet is Ego.

00:58:19.685 --> 00:58:21.880
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

00:58:22.685 --> 00:58:23.879
And you're not a flea?

00:58:24.085 --> 00:58:26.394
I'm a flea with a purpose.

00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:28.603
I help him sleep.

00:58:29.845 --> 00:58:32.917
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

00:58:38.005 --> 00:58:39.040
Nothing.

00:58:40.085 --> 00:58:41.882
Your quarters are this way.

00:58:49.565 --> 00:58:52.955
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:58.402
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

00:58:59.165 --> 00:59:01.121
Okay, Taserface.

00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:03.955
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

00:59:04.125 --> 00:59:05.524
"Hi," Taserface!

00:59:10.765 --> 00:59:13.199
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

00:59:13.405 --> 00:59:14.918
No, Gef.

00:59:15.085 --> 00:59:16.757
It's too adorable to kill.

00:59:16.925 --> 00:59:18.756
Take it to the tailor.

00:59:20.365 --> 00:59:23.596
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:30.795
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

00:59:33.485 --> 00:59:36.124
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

00:59:36.245 --> 00:59:40.682
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

00:59:40.845 --> 00:59:42.642
But I was young...

00:59:43.605 --> 00:59:47.041
and greedy, and stupid.

00:59:48.005 --> 00:59:50.121
Like you stealing those batteries.

00:59:50.285 --> 00:59:51.798
That was mostly Drax.

00:59:53.245 --> 00:59:56.794
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

00:59:57.765 --> 01:00:00.074
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.

01:00:01.045 --> 01:00:02.956
The only family I ever had.

01:00:04.405 --> 01:00:06.077
When I broke the code...

01:00:08.325 --> 01:00:09.997
they exiled me.

01:00:11.325 --> 01:00:12.758
This is what I deserve.

01:00:12.965 --> 01:00:14.637
Slow down, drama queen.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.483
You might deserve this, but I don't.

01:00:16.645 --> 01:00:18.397
We gotta get outta here.

01:00:19.885 --> 01:00:21.000
Where's Quill?

01:00:21.165 --> 01:00:22.723
He went off with his old man.

01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:26.163
- Ego?
- Yeah.

01:00:26.325 --> 01:00:28.281
It's a day for dumbass names.

01:00:31.405 --> 01:00:33.794
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:36.718
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:39.273
You like a professional asshole or what?

01:00:39.445 --> 01:00:40.445
Pretty much a pro.

01:00:40.525 --> 01:00:43.198
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

01:00:43.845 --> 01:00:45.563
He was skinny.

01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:50.077
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

01:00:50.565 --> 01:00:51.565
Uh-huh.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:58.202
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:01.679
But we're gonna need your little friend.

01:01:02.845 --> 01:01:05.200
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

01:01:16.445 --> 01:01:18.640
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

01:01:24.725 --> 01:01:27.444
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

01:01:27.605 --> 01:01:29.482
He's goddang precious!

01:01:42.245 --> 01:01:43.245
Psst!

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:45.243
Hey, twig!

01:01:45.565 --> 01:01:46.964
Come here.

01:01:47.445 --> 01:01:48.673
Come on.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:56.245
Aw, man...

01:01:56.445 --> 01:01:57.878
what did they do to you?

01:02:01.005 --> 01:02:03.439
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:07.482
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

01:02:07.645 --> 01:02:11.684
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

01:02:11.885 --> 01:02:13.477
the thing I wore on my head.

01:02:14.205 --> 01:02:18.244
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

01:02:18.445 --> 01:02:19.719
You got it?

01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:54.964
That's my underwears.

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:57.341
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

01:02:57.365 --> 01:02:59.356
You have to explain it more careful.

01:03:00.925 --> 01:03:04.315
It's a prototype fin.

01:03:09.805 --> 01:03:12.558
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

01:03:12.725 --> 01:03:14.317
You explain it this time.

01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:17.004
All right.

01:03:17.845 --> 01:03:19.722
That's Vorker's eye.

01:03:19.885 --> 01:03:21.876
He takes it out when he sleeps.

01:03:22.045 --> 01:03:23.398
Go. Look again.

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:24.964
But leave the eye here.

01:03:25.325 --> 01:03:26.440
Why?

01:03:26.605 --> 01:03:27.958
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

01:03:28.165 --> 01:03:30.520
and he's not gonna know...

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.915
where his eye is!

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.683
That's a desk.

01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:43.558
We told you it was this big.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.720
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:54.604
with a bunch of severed human toes.

01:03:54.765 --> 01:03:58.360
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

01:04:01.645 --> 01:04:05.320
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

01:04:05.485 --> 01:04:06.838
Okay?

01:04:15.365 --> 01:04:17.242
What? No!

01:04:17.405 --> 01:04:18.661
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

01:04:18.685 --> 01:04:20.004
That's not what I said!

01:04:20.165 --> 01:04:21.165
I am Groot.

01:04:21.245 --> 01:04:22.421
He's relieved you don't want him to.

01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:23.924
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

01:04:24.085 --> 01:04:24.756
I am Groot.

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:26.114
On anyone, not just himself.

01:04:26.285 --> 01:04:27.115
I am Groot.

01:04:27.205 --> 01:04:29.261
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

01:04:29.285 --> 01:04:32.141
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

01:04:32.165 --> 01:04:33.439
That's why you don't like hats?

01:04:34.645 --> 01:04:36.920
This is an important conversation
right now?

01:05:13.645 --> 01:05:14.645
That ain't it.

01:05:24.565 --> 01:05:25.998
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

01:05:29.045 --> 01:05:30.876
They killed all my friends.

01:05:34.925 --> 01:05:37.439
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

01:05:44.165 --> 01:05:45.165
One more thing.

01:05:47.005 --> 01:05:49.314
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?

01:06:32.445 --> 01:06:33.514
Ah.

01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:41.116
He's got it!

01:06:41.285 --> 01:06:42.798
<i>Yondu's got the fin!</i>

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:43.965
Go!

01:07:25.405 --> 01:07:26.405
Down there!

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:51.956
Oh!

01:09:25.045 --> 01:09:26.478
You maniac.

01:09:28.525 --> 01:09:30.720
The whole ship's gonna blow.

01:09:40.645 --> 01:09:42.237
Not the whole ship.

01:09:59.205 --> 01:10:00.240
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:04.683
I am sending you
the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:07.042
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

01:10:07.205 --> 01:10:09.719
I only ask one thing.

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:11.843
That your High Priestess...

01:10:12.005 --> 01:10:15.475
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

01:10:16.565 --> 01:10:19.682
Taserface!

01:10:42.045 --> 01:10:43.273
Where to, Captain?

01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:44.445
Ego.

01:10:46.085 --> 01:10:47.120
No, boy!

01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:59.556
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

01:10:59.725 --> 01:11:00.725
I know that.

01:11:00.845 --> 01:11:03.200
We are about to do 700!

01:11:17.085 --> 01:11:19.201
So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

01:11:20.565 --> 01:11:23.079
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

01:11:30.325 --> 01:11:32.043
What are you doing, Peter?

01:11:34.325 --> 01:11:35.644
Dance with me.

01:11:35.885 --> 01:11:37.318
I'm not going to dance with you.

01:11:37.525 --> 01:11:39.243
This is Sam Cooke...

01:11:39.805 --> 01:11:42.956
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:14.116
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:17.805
If you ever tell anyone about this...

01:12:17.965 --> 01:12:19.364
I will kill you.

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:24.004
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

01:12:24.645 --> 01:12:26.044
What unspoken thing?

01:12:27.525 --> 01:12:29.197
This...

01:12:29.365 --> 01:12:32.163
<i>Cheers,</i> Sam and Diane...

01:12:32.325 --> 01:12:34.885
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

01:12:35.085 --> 01:12:36.501
but never say it because if they do,

01:12:36.525 --> 01:12:37.645
the ratings would go down...

01:12:37.765 --> 01:12:38.834
sort of thing.

01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:40.438
There's no unspoken thing.

01:12:42.365 --> 01:12:44.401
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:45.634
then it would be spoken...

01:12:45.845 --> 01:12:48.564
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:52.883
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

01:12:53.045 --> 01:12:54.956
No, that's not what I...

01:12:57.285 --> 01:13:01.324
What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.

01:13:01.525 --> 01:13:03.197
It doesn't feel right.

01:13:03.765 --> 01:13:05.915
What are you talking about?

01:13:06.085 --> 01:13:07.501
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:08.753
That girl Mantis...

01:13:08.925 --> 01:13:09.994
she's afraid of something.

01:13:10.445 --> 01:13:12.481
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

01:13:12.725 --> 01:13:13.840
I'm not trying...

01:13:14.005 --> 01:13:15.916
He's my father. He's blood.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.901
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

01:13:17.925 --> 01:13:20.041
Again, you made me come here!

01:13:20.205 --> 01:13:22.261
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

01:13:22.285 --> 01:13:24.924
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

01:13:25.165 --> 01:13:27.838
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

01:13:28.005 --> 01:13:29.365
That's the half I'm worried about.

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.643
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

01:13:31.845 --> 01:13:34.154
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

01:13:34.325 --> 01:13:36.839
You were insufferable to begin with.

01:13:37.005 --> 01:13:38.301
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

01:13:38.325 --> 01:13:39.821
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

01:13:39.845 --> 01:13:42.803
You know what?
This is not <i>Cheers</i> after all!

01:13:42.965 --> 01:13:45.798
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

01:13:45.965 --> 01:13:47.683
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

01:13:47.765 --> 01:13:49.437
and the other person is a jerk...

01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:51.402
who doesn't trust anybody!

01:13:51.485 --> 01:13:53.237
It's a show that doesn't exist.

01:13:53.405 --> 01:13:54.885
That's why it would get zero ratings!

01:13:55.325 --> 01:13:57.441
I don't know what <i>Cheers</i> is!

01:13:57.645 --> 01:14:00.603
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

01:14:01.845 --> 01:14:03.483
I thought you already had.

01:14:33.005 --> 01:14:34.233
Damn it.

01:15:07.325 --> 01:15:08.394
Psychopath!

01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:20.517
Are you kidding me?

01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:47.965
I win.

01:17:48.565 --> 01:17:50.760
I win. I bested you in combat.

01:17:50.925 --> 01:17:52.836
No. I saved your life.

01:17:53.005 --> 01:17:54.836
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

01:17:55.005 --> 01:17:56.005
You let me live!

01:17:56.045 --> 01:17:57.922
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

01:17:58.085 --> 01:17:59.501
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe

01:17:59.525 --> 01:18:00.719
just because I wanted to win.

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:02.523
Do not tell me what I want.

01:18:02.605 --> 01:18:04.165
I don't need to tell you what you want!

01:18:04.205 --> 01:18:05.205
It's obvious!

01:18:05.365 --> 01:18:08.323
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

01:18:16.205 --> 01:18:17.718
You were all I had.

01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:21.758
But you were the one
who needed to win.

01:18:23.085 --> 01:18:25.280
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

01:18:26.085 --> 01:18:28.076
and my brain from my skull...

01:18:29.245 --> 01:18:31.122
and my arm from my body...

01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:34.881
because of you.

01:18:55.805 --> 01:18:56.920
You all right, son?

01:19:00.285 --> 01:19:02.924
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

01:19:03.565 --> 01:19:04.918
Yeah.

01:19:05.085 --> 01:19:06.803
It's fortuitous...

01:19:06.965 --> 01:19:08.193
you listening to this song.

01:19:08.365 --> 01:19:09.923
- You know...
<i>- Brandy?</i>

01:19:10.405 --> 01:19:11.440
By Looking Glass?

01:19:13.325 --> 01:19:14.765
A favorite of your mom's.

01:19:15.605 --> 01:19:17.118
Yeah, it was.

01:19:17.565 --> 01:19:19.325
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

01:19:19.405 --> 01:19:21.475
Perhaps its very greatest.

01:19:21.645 --> 01:19:22.645
Yes!

01:19:22.805 --> 01:19:25.922
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

01:19:28.205 --> 01:19:29.957
<i>He came on a summer's day</i>

01:19:30.445 --> 01:19:32.913
<i>Bringing gifts from far away</i>

01:19:35.005 --> 01:19:37.473
Like the child I put in your mother...

01:19:37.645 --> 01:19:39.556
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

01:19:41.725 --> 01:19:44.762
<i>Brandy, you're a fine girl</i>

01:19:44.925 --> 01:19:47.564
<i>What a good wife you would be</i>

01:19:48.685 --> 01:19:51.324
<i>My life, my love</i>

01:19:51.485 --> 01:19:54.761
<i>My lady is the sea</i>

01:19:54.925 --> 01:19:56.756
The sea calls the sailor back.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.439
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

01:20:00.245 --> 01:20:04.158
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

01:20:05.445 --> 01:20:08.881
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

01:20:09.525 --> 01:20:11.641
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

01:20:11.805 --> 01:20:12.920
No, Peter...

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.036
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

01:20:15.525 --> 01:20:17.595
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

01:20:18.645 --> 01:20:19.680
I'm immortal?

01:20:20.205 --> 01:20:21.205
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:22.005 --> 01:20:23.040
Really?

01:20:23.205 --> 01:20:26.038
Yes! As long as the light exists.

01:20:27.045 --> 01:20:30.276
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

01:20:30.445 --> 01:20:32.754
like how you made this whole planet?

01:20:32.925 --> 01:20:35.280
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

01:20:35.445 --> 01:20:37.720
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

01:20:37.885 --> 01:20:38.885
What!

01:20:39.165 --> 01:20:42.635
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:43.840
and Heather Locklear.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.165
You can do anything you want.

01:20:45.365 --> 01:20:46.639
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

01:20:46.805 --> 01:20:49.956
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

01:20:50.125 --> 01:20:52.639
Only we can remake the universe.

01:20:52.805 --> 01:20:55.273
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

01:20:55.445 --> 01:20:58.278
and lead it to where it needs to go.

01:20:59.445 --> 01:21:00.480
How?

01:21:10.965 --> 01:21:12.318
Come with me.

01:21:22.325 --> 01:21:23.917
Drax, Drax. Drax!

01:21:24.365 --> 01:21:25.923
Drax! We need to talk.

01:21:28.085 --> 01:21:29.916
I'm sorry.

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:32.280
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

01:21:32.445 --> 01:21:33.514
What?

01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:36.916
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.478
No, that's not what I...

01:21:42.085 --> 01:21:43.484
What are you doing?

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:46.434
I'm imagining being with you physically.

01:21:46.605 --> 01:21:47.924
Drax...

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:49.594
I don't like you like that.

01:21:49.805 --> 01:21:52.114
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

01:21:52.285 --> 01:21:54.719
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

01:21:54.885 --> 01:21:57.445
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

01:21:57.645 --> 01:21:59.363
I should have told you earlier.

01:21:59.565 --> 01:22:02.557
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

01:22:08.325 --> 01:22:09.325
What is that?

01:22:12.925 --> 01:22:16.361
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

01:22:16.605 --> 01:22:19.677
Everything around us,
including the girl...

01:22:19.845 --> 01:22:23.315
Everything is temporary.

01:22:23.485 --> 01:22:26.283
We are forever.

01:22:26.565 --> 01:22:27.918
Doesn't eternity get boring?

01:22:28.085 --> 01:22:30.474
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.601
which is why you're here.

01:22:32.805 --> 01:22:34.921
I told you how all those years ago...

01:22:35.085 --> 01:22:39.203
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

01:22:39.365 --> 01:22:43.404
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

01:22:44.085 --> 01:22:45.359
it was all so...

01:22:47.845 --> 01:22:49.676
disappointing.

01:22:50.005 --> 01:22:53.520
<i>And that is when I came...</i>

01:22:53.685 --> 01:22:57.360
to a profound realization.

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:02.838
My innate desire to seek out other life...

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:07.597
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

01:23:09.845 --> 01:23:10.994
Peter...

01:23:12.045 --> 01:23:15.242
I have found meaning.

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.478
I see it.

01:23:38.925 --> 01:23:40.677
Eternity!

01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:42.604
Oh, my God.

01:23:53.245 --> 01:23:55.122
We need to get off this planet.

01:24:08.965 --> 01:24:10.239
Oh, man.

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.754
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

01:24:12.925 --> 01:24:15.803
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

01:24:26.805 --> 01:24:28.955
What the hell you doing, boy?

01:24:29.045 --> 01:24:31.115
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

01:24:31.285 --> 01:24:32.604
this Ego is bad news.

01:24:32.765 --> 01:24:34.403
We're here to save Quill.

01:24:34.565 --> 01:24:38.604
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

01:24:38.845 --> 01:24:41.757
No. I don't care about those things.

01:24:41.925 --> 01:24:44.155
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!

01:24:44.325 --> 01:24:47.078
I can lord this over him forever.

01:24:48.925 --> 01:24:50.677
What are you laughing at me for?

01:24:51.325 --> 01:24:56.035
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

01:24:56.205 --> 01:24:57.479
I know who you are.

01:24:57.645 --> 01:24:59.795
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

01:24:59.965 --> 01:25:02.240
I know everything about you.

01:25:02.805 --> 01:25:05.194
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

01:25:05.365 --> 01:25:06.861
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

01:25:06.885 --> 01:25:07.885
Shut up!

01:25:07.925 --> 01:25:10.280
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

01:25:10.445 --> 01:25:13.039
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

01:25:13.205 --> 01:25:14.621
because just a little bit of love...

01:25:14.645 --> 01:25:17.921
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

01:25:18.325 --> 01:25:19.553
I said shut up!

01:25:20.045 --> 01:25:23.117
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.604
I'm serious, dude!

01:25:24.765 --> 01:25:27.325
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

01:25:27.485 --> 01:25:29.362
their own little baby, into slavery.

01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:32.235
I know who you are, boy.

01:25:32.445 --> 01:25:34.436
Because you're me.

01:25:40.965 --> 01:25:43.035
What kind of a pair are we?

01:25:44.365 --> 01:25:47.402
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

01:25:47.565 --> 01:25:50.637
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

01:25:51.165 --> 01:25:52.439
Fight a what?

01:25:56.965 --> 01:25:57.965
Who are you people?

01:25:58.085 --> 01:25:59.085
What is this place?

01:25:59.205 --> 01:26:00.205
Gamora, let her go!

01:26:00.365 --> 01:26:02.401
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

01:26:02.565 --> 01:26:04.874
You are scared.

01:26:08.405 --> 01:26:11.283
I call it the Expansion.

01:26:12.405 --> 01:26:15.715
It is my purpose...

01:26:15.885 --> 01:26:19.400
and now it is yours as well.

01:26:20.285 --> 01:26:21.718
It's beautiful.

01:26:22.965 --> 01:26:25.240
Over thousands of years...

01:26:25.405 --> 01:26:28.556
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:31.444
on thousands of worlds.

01:26:31.605 --> 01:26:35.393
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:37.442
To grow and spread...

01:26:37.605 --> 01:26:40.722
covering all that exists...

01:26:40.925 --> 01:26:44.964
until everything is...

01:26:46.365 --> 01:26:47.365
Me!

01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:50.395
What did she do to me?

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.197
She already told me everything.

01:26:52.365 --> 01:26:54.925
I only had one problem.

01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:58.637
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power

01:26:58.725 --> 01:27:00.681
for such an enterprise.

01:27:00.845 --> 01:27:02.961
But two Celestials...

01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:06.435
Well, now, that just might do.

01:27:09.205 --> 01:27:10.558
The bodies...

01:27:11.325 --> 01:27:13.600
are his children.

01:27:14.165 --> 01:27:15.359
<i>Out of all my labors...</i>

01:27:15.885 --> 01:27:17.762
the most beguiling was...

01:27:17.965 --> 01:27:21.321
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

01:27:21.485 --> 01:27:24.397
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

01:27:24.565 --> 01:27:26.396
to power the Expansion.

01:27:27.485 --> 01:27:29.999
<i>I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.</i>

01:27:30.165 --> 01:27:33.555
<i>It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...</i>

01:27:33.725 --> 01:27:37.479
<i>and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.</i>

01:27:37.645 --> 01:27:40.205
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

01:27:40.405 --> 01:27:43.681
But one after the other, they failed me.

01:27:43.845 --> 01:27:47.679
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

01:27:47.845 --> 01:27:48.994
Until you, Peter.

01:27:50.325 --> 01:27:52.885
Out of all my spawn...

01:27:53.085 --> 01:27:57.158
only you carried
the connection to the light.

01:27:57.325 --> 01:28:00.203
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

01:28:00.365 --> 01:28:02.959
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

01:28:04.165 --> 01:28:05.564
- Then we just go.
- No!

01:28:05.765 --> 01:28:07.995
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

01:28:08.165 --> 01:28:10.315
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:11.838
You're right.

01:28:12.365 --> 01:28:13.400
We're family.

01:28:15.325 --> 01:28:16.838
We leave no one behind.

01:28:20.325 --> 01:28:21.599
Except maybe you.

01:28:22.205 --> 01:28:23.684
Oh, my God.

01:28:24.405 --> 01:28:26.475
For the first time in my existence...

01:28:26.645 --> 01:28:29.557
I am truly not alone!

01:28:35.125 --> 01:28:36.274
What is it, son?

01:28:39.645 --> 01:28:40.794
My friends.

01:28:42.165 --> 01:28:46.204
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

01:28:46.525 --> 01:28:47.525
Yes.

01:28:47.805 --> 01:28:50.877
We are beyond such things.

01:28:51.045 --> 01:28:52.045
Yes.

01:28:54.365 --> 01:28:55.593
- Now...
- But my mother...

01:28:58.565 --> 01:29:00.874
You said you loved my mother.

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:02.558
And that I did.

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:08.674
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

01:29:10.485 --> 01:29:13.158
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

01:29:13.325 --> 01:29:15.839
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

01:29:16.005 --> 01:29:17.563
I'd never leave.

01:29:18.685 --> 01:29:20.243
The Expansion...

01:29:21.645 --> 01:29:24.000
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

01:29:24.165 --> 01:29:26.201
So, I did what I had to do.

01:29:29.005 --> 01:29:32.395
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

01:29:36.765 --> 01:29:37.834
What?

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:39.563
Now, all right...

01:29:39.725 --> 01:29:41.363
I know that sounds bad.

01:29:53.405 --> 01:29:56.841
Who in the hell do you think you are?

01:29:57.005 --> 01:29:58.563
You killed my mother!

01:29:58.725 --> 01:29:59.760
I tried...

01:29:59.925 --> 01:30:01.677
so hard...

01:30:01.845 --> 01:30:03.324
to find the form...

01:30:03.485 --> 01:30:05.874
that best suited you...

01:30:06.045 --> 01:30:08.354
and this is the thanks I get?

01:30:10.165 --> 01:30:12.554
You really need to grow up.

01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:19.043
I wanted to do this together...

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:21.161
but I suppose you'll have to learn

01:30:21.245 --> 01:30:24.555
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!

01:30:26.285 --> 01:30:27.957
Finally! Rocket?

01:30:28.125 --> 01:30:30.958
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.322
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

01:30:34.485 --> 01:30:35.901
<i>to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.</i>

01:30:35.925 --> 01:30:36.925
Ego's unhinged.

01:30:36.965 --> 01:30:38.444
<i>I know. Get ready.</i>

01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:39.879
Drop her, Kraglin.

01:30:58.485 --> 01:30:59.634
No.

01:31:10.805 --> 01:31:13.638
<i>My life, my love</i>

01:31:13.805 --> 01:31:16.000
<i>My lady is the sea</i>

01:31:18.165 --> 01:31:19.280
Peter...

01:31:20.085 --> 01:31:22.280
this is the sea.

01:31:24.365 --> 01:31:25.365
Oh...

01:32:05.565 --> 01:32:07.157
Hey, there, jackass!

01:32:17.485 --> 01:32:18.998
What is that thing?

01:32:26.525 --> 01:32:28.356
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

01:32:33.205 --> 01:32:35.878
I told you something didn't feel right.

01:32:36.045 --> 01:32:38.354
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

01:32:38.525 --> 01:32:40.197
Well, I came back, didn't I?

01:32:40.845 --> 01:32:42.205
Because there's an unspoken thing.

01:32:42.325 --> 01:32:44.395
There is no unspoken thing.

01:32:44.565 --> 01:32:46.405
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

01:32:46.885 --> 01:32:48.443
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:49.799
We had it under control.

01:32:50.005 --> 01:32:52.280
We did not.
That is only an extension...

01:32:52.445 --> 01:32:54.481
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

01:32:54.645 --> 01:32:55.919
What's Smurfette doing here?

01:32:56.085 --> 01:32:57.996
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

01:32:58.165 --> 01:32:59.393
She tried to murder me!

01:32:59.565 --> 01:33:01.556
I saved you, you stupid fox!

01:33:01.765 --> 01:33:02.993
He's not a fox.

01:33:03.165 --> 01:33:05.235
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

01:33:05.405 --> 01:33:06.405
I am Groot.

01:33:06.605 --> 01:33:08.004
"Raccoon." Whatever.

01:33:11.525 --> 01:33:12.844
How do we kill a Celestial?

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:14.438
There's a center to him.

01:33:14.605 --> 01:33:16.721
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

01:33:16.805 --> 01:33:18.005
Some sort of protective shell.

01:33:18.445 --> 01:33:19.480
It's in the caverns...

01:33:19.645 --> 01:33:20.645
below the surface.

01:33:23.325 --> 01:33:24.838
Yondu?

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:34.640
Thrusters are out.

01:33:35.205 --> 01:33:37.036
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

01:33:37.205 --> 01:33:39.165
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

01:33:39.205 --> 01:33:40.461
You still reckon that's the reason

01:33:40.485 --> 01:33:41.645
I kept you around, you idiot?

01:33:41.805 --> 01:33:43.405
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

01:33:43.925 --> 01:33:46.045
Once I figured out what
happened to them other kids...

01:33:46.165 --> 01:33:47.757
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

01:33:47.925 --> 01:33:49.517
You said you were gonna eat me.

01:33:49.685 --> 01:33:51.084
That was being funny!

01:33:51.925 --> 01:33:53.119
Not to me!

01:33:53.285 --> 01:33:54.513
You people have issues.

01:33:54.685 --> 01:33:56.403
Of course I have issues.

01:33:57.365 --> 01:34:00.163
That's my freakin' father!

01:34:00.365 --> 01:34:01.923
Thrusters are back up.

01:34:15.525 --> 01:34:17.675
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:20.353
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

01:34:20.525 --> 01:34:21.924
We have to kill him.

01:34:22.085 --> 01:34:22.756
Rocket!

01:34:22.925 --> 01:34:23.925
Got it!

01:34:30.205 --> 01:34:32.639
Whoo-hoo!

01:34:37.845 --> 01:34:39.676
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

01:34:39.845 --> 01:34:40.880
I guess.

01:34:41.045 --> 01:34:42.045
Awesome!

01:34:44.205 --> 01:34:46.355
We're really gonna be able
to jack up our prices...

01:34:46.525 --> 01:34:48.163
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

01:34:48.325 --> 01:34:50.885
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:53.804
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

01:34:54.005 --> 01:34:56.245
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

01:34:56.405 --> 01:34:58.157
and all the animals on the planets.

01:34:58.325 --> 01:34:59.519
And the people.

01:34:59.685 --> 01:35:00.879
Meh.

01:35:01.405 --> 01:35:05.444
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

01:35:43.205 --> 01:35:44.205
<i>Pilots...</i>

01:35:44.365 --> 01:35:45.718
release envoy units.

01:35:48.005 --> 01:35:49.892
<i>Our sensors detect
the batteries</i>

01:35:49.922 --> 01:35:52.044
<i>are below the surface
of the planet.</i>

01:35:53.925 --> 01:35:54.994
Dive!

01:36:11.845 --> 01:36:13.324
Um... Captain?

01:36:14.125 --> 01:36:15.524
<i>Captain?</i>

01:36:20.485 --> 01:36:22.157
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

01:36:22.685 --> 01:36:24.461
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

01:36:24.485 --> 01:36:26.680
to help destroy the universe.

01:36:26.885 --> 01:36:29.035
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

01:36:29.205 --> 01:36:30.320
So, could you?

01:36:30.485 --> 01:36:31.679
A little.

01:36:31.845 --> 01:36:33.073
I made a ball.

01:36:33.245 --> 01:36:34.245
A ball?

01:36:34.405 --> 01:36:36.123
I thought as hard as I could.

01:36:36.205 --> 01:36:37.763
It was all that I could come up with.

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.244
You "thought"?

01:36:39.445 --> 01:36:41.515
You think when I make this arrow fly...

01:36:41.685 --> 01:36:43.516
I use my head?

01:36:55.005 --> 01:36:56.324
Whoa.

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:06.085
There.

01:37:06.245 --> 01:37:08.201
That's Ego's core.

01:37:10.565 --> 01:37:12.203
That ore is thick, Rocket.

01:37:12.365 --> 01:37:14.003
I got it covered.

01:37:20.485 --> 01:37:21.804
We must hurry.

01:37:21.965 --> 01:37:24.001
It will not take Ego long to find us.

01:37:28.325 --> 01:37:29.519
Keep it steady.

01:37:36.005 --> 01:37:37.961
We drill into the center, we kill him!

01:37:44.485 --> 01:37:45.713
<i>Captain?</i>

01:37:46.125 --> 01:37:47.160
What is it, Kraglin?

01:37:47.325 --> 01:37:49.281
<i>Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?</i>

01:37:49.845 --> 01:37:51.756
- Yeah, why?
<i>- Uh...</i>

01:37:52.045 --> 01:37:53.239
Oh, hell!

01:38:13.845 --> 01:38:15.437
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

01:38:15.885 --> 01:38:17.603
They blew out the generator.

01:38:17.765 --> 01:38:20.563
I think I packed a small detonator.

01:38:20.725 --> 01:38:22.421
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

01:38:22.445 --> 01:38:23.924
Well, we got these.

01:38:24.685 --> 01:38:26.721
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

01:38:26.925 --> 01:38:28.802
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...

01:38:28.965 --> 01:38:30.637
throughout his entire nervous system.

01:38:30.845 --> 01:38:31.595
Meaning what?

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:33.318
The entire planet will explode.

01:38:33.485 --> 01:38:34.918
We'll have to get out of here fast.

01:38:35.085 --> 01:38:36.677
I rigged a timer.

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:38.714
Go!

01:38:52.925 --> 01:38:54.643
He's coming.

01:38:56.085 --> 01:38:57.803
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?

01:38:58.325 --> 01:39:00.714
When he wants. He's too powerful.

01:39:00.885 --> 01:39:02.204
I can't!

01:39:02.725 --> 01:39:04.602
You don't have to believe in yourself...

01:39:05.325 --> 01:39:07.361
because I believe in you.

01:39:19.765 --> 01:39:20.765
Sleep!

01:39:28.165 --> 01:39:29.805
I never thought she'd be able to do it...

01:39:29.885 --> 01:39:32.115
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

01:39:33.045 --> 01:39:35.957
I don't know how long I can hold him.

01:39:39.285 --> 01:39:40.957
The metal's too thick.

01:39:41.165 --> 01:39:44.441
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

01:39:44.605 --> 01:39:46.925
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

01:39:47.565 --> 01:39:48.565
<i>Well...</i>

01:39:51.365 --> 01:39:53.196
That's a terrible idea.

01:39:53.365 --> 01:39:55.640
<i>Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.</i>

01:39:56.645 --> 01:39:58.124
Unbelievable.

01:39:58.285 --> 01:40:00.480
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

01:40:02.085 --> 01:40:03.564
<i>What a day.</i>

01:40:11.125 --> 01:40:14.720
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

01:40:14.885 --> 01:40:16.034
That activates it.

01:40:16.245 --> 01:40:18.042
Then you push this button...

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:21.282
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

01:40:21.445 --> 01:40:22.719
Now, whatever you do...

01:40:23.365 --> 01:40:25.754
don't push this button...

01:40:25.925 --> 01:40:27.995
because that will set off
the bomb immediately

01:40:28.085 --> 01:40:29.564
and we'll all be dead.

01:40:29.685 --> 01:40:32.119
Now, repeat back what I just said.

01:40:32.285 --> 01:40:33.957
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

01:40:34.245 --> 01:40:36.201
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

01:40:36.365 --> 01:40:37.480
- I am Groot.
- No!

01:40:37.925 --> 01:40:40.234
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

01:40:40.405 --> 01:40:41.405
Try again.

01:40:42.645 --> 01:40:43.794
Hmm...

01:40:44.445 --> 01:40:46.197
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:40:46.445 --> 01:40:48.515
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

01:40:48.685 --> 01:40:49.685
I am Groot.

01:40:49.765 --> 01:40:51.596
No! That's exactly what you just said!

01:40:51.765 --> 01:40:53.357
How is that even possible?

01:40:53.525 --> 01:40:55.755
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:56.994
Point to it.

01:40:57.165 --> 01:40:58.165
No!

01:40:58.485 --> 01:41:00.237
<i>Hey, you're
making him nervous!</i>

01:41:00.405 --> 01:41:02.157
Shut up and get me some tape!

01:41:02.325 --> 01:41:03.805
Does anybody have any tape out there?

01:41:03.845 --> 01:41:05.597
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

01:41:05.765 --> 01:41:08.643
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

01:41:08.805 --> 01:41:11.478
<i>Yo, Yondu... Ow!</i>

01:41:11.605 --> 01:41:13.755
<i>Do you have any tape?</i>

01:41:16.085 --> 01:41:19.122
<i>Gamora? Do you have any tape?</i>

01:41:19.285 --> 01:41:20.320
<i>Tape!</i>

01:41:20.485 --> 01:41:22.919
<i>Never mind. Ow!</i>

01:41:23.845 --> 01:41:26.359
<i>Drax, do you have any tape?</i>

01:41:26.445 --> 01:41:29.118
<i>Yes, Scotch tape would work.</i>

01:41:29.405 --> 01:41:31.365
<i>Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,</i>

01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:32.964
<i>if you don't have any?</i>

01:41:33.965 --> 01:41:35.193
Nobody has any tape!

01:41:35.405 --> 01:41:36.724
Not a single person has tape?

01:41:37.125 --> 01:41:38.125
Nope!

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.440
Did you ask Nebula?

01:41:40.325 --> 01:41:40.996
Yes!

01:41:41.205 --> 01:41:42.479
Are you sure?

01:41:42.645 --> 01:41:43.964
I asked Yondu...

01:41:44.165 --> 01:41:46.341
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

01:41:46.365 --> 01:41:48.621
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

01:41:48.645 --> 01:41:51.034
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

01:41:51.205 --> 01:41:54.720
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

01:41:54.925 --> 01:41:57.393
You are wasting a lot of time here!

01:41:59.885 --> 01:42:01.000
Whee!

01:42:03.765 --> 01:42:05.676
We're all gonna die.

01:42:07.405 --> 01:42:09.521
Rear thrusters are out again!

01:42:09.765 --> 01:42:12.438
We're done for without that generator!

01:42:25.805 --> 01:42:27.033
<i>Guardians...</i>

01:42:27.845 --> 01:42:29.517
<i>perhaps it will provide you solace...</i>

01:42:29.685 --> 01:42:32.279
<i>that your deaths
are not without purpose.</i>

01:42:32.845 --> 01:42:34.403
<i>They will serve as a warning...</i>

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:36.954
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:40.283
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

01:42:44.045 --> 01:42:45.114
This is gonna hurt.

01:42:45.285 --> 01:42:46.798
Promises, promises.

01:42:57.245 --> 01:42:58.245
Hey!

01:43:09.885 --> 01:43:10.885
No!

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.601
No! No! No!

01:43:19.085 --> 01:43:20.085
<i>We're gonna blow!</i>

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:27.276
Peter! No!

01:43:47.205 --> 01:43:48.205
What?

01:43:48.525 --> 01:43:50.516
You look like Mary Poppins.

01:43:50.685 --> 01:43:52.084
Is he cool?

01:43:53.885 --> 01:43:55.523
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

01:43:56.285 --> 01:43:58.162
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

01:44:25.605 --> 01:44:27.561
Mantis, look out!

01:44:39.685 --> 01:44:41.277
She's just unconscious.

01:44:57.325 --> 01:44:58.883
How long until the bomb goes off?

01:44:59.045 --> 01:45:01.400
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

01:45:01.565 --> 01:45:02.714
about six minutes.

01:45:07.765 --> 01:45:10.279
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

01:45:10.445 --> 01:45:11.445
<i>T-minus five minutes.</i>

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:12.754
Aye, Captain.

01:45:16.645 --> 01:45:18.525
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

01:45:19.805 --> 01:45:21.318
Drax, take Mantis.

01:45:24.205 --> 01:45:25.479
Ow! My nipples!

01:45:34.165 --> 01:45:35.359
Gamora!

01:45:38.685 --> 01:45:39.720
Peter!

01:46:06.045 --> 01:46:07.364
Get over it.

01:46:07.845 --> 01:46:11.554
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

01:46:13.725 --> 01:46:18.082
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

01:46:47.645 --> 01:46:49.636
Yeah!

01:46:49.725 --> 01:46:53.354
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

01:46:54.045 --> 01:46:57.117
So stop pissing me off!

01:47:17.365 --> 01:47:19.005
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

01:47:27.125 --> 01:47:28.125
Go!

01:49:27.525 --> 01:49:29.117
I told you...

01:49:29.285 --> 01:49:33.119
I don't want to do this alone.

01:49:36.325 --> 01:49:37.360
You cannot deny...

01:49:37.485 --> 01:49:41.797
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

01:49:51.045 --> 01:49:52.763
Everyone,
I need you to stay back!

01:49:52.925 --> 01:49:53.925
What is that?

01:50:09.685 --> 01:50:11.880
<i>It doesn't need to be
like this, Peter.</i>

01:50:14.045 --> 01:50:17.037
Why are you destroying our chance?

01:50:19.805 --> 01:50:22.922
<i>Stop pretending you aren't
what you are.</i>

01:50:24.765 --> 01:50:25.765
<i>One in billions.</i>

01:50:27.525 --> 01:50:29.356
<i>Trillions. Even more.</i>

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:36.082
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:42.838
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

01:50:43.445 --> 01:50:45.322
I use my heart...

01:51:20.565 --> 01:51:24.274
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

01:51:24.445 --> 01:51:28.040
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

01:51:28.245 --> 01:51:30.554
<i>You will never love me again</i>

01:51:30.765 --> 01:51:33.598
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

01:51:33.805 --> 01:51:37.718
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

01:51:37.925 --> 01:51:39.836
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

01:51:40.085 --> 01:51:42.645
<i>You will never love me again</i>

01:51:43.405 --> 01:51:47.557
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

01:51:47.765 --> 01:51:50.518
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

01:51:50.725 --> 01:51:53.159
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

01:51:53.325 --> 01:51:56.317
<i>You will never love me again</i>

01:51:56.525 --> 01:51:59.244
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

01:51:59.365 --> 01:52:01.925
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

01:52:04.605 --> 01:52:07.517
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

01:52:07.685 --> 01:52:10.722
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

01:52:11.205 --> 01:52:12.763
Groot, hurry!

01:53:08.525 --> 01:53:10.675
Yondu, we're about to blow!

01:53:10.965 --> 01:53:12.318
Get to the ship!

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:13.520
Not without Quill!

01:53:13.965 --> 01:53:15.842
You need to take care of the twig!

01:53:17.205 --> 01:53:18.923
Not without you!

01:53:20.165 --> 01:53:23.475
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

01:53:26.845 --> 01:53:28.961
You need to give me this.

01:53:37.205 --> 01:53:38.205
Uh...

01:53:39.285 --> 01:53:41.753
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

01:53:41.965 --> 01:53:44.035
I only have one of each.

01:53:56.365 --> 01:53:57.923
I am Groot.

01:53:58.725 --> 01:53:59.794
What's that?

01:54:01.525 --> 01:54:05.723
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

01:54:06.325 --> 01:54:08.600
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

01:54:14.925 --> 01:54:15.994
Bye, twig.

01:54:17.925 --> 01:54:21.395
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

01:55:16.125 --> 01:55:17.125
Where's Peter?

01:55:17.965 --> 01:55:19.921
Rocket, where is he?

01:55:20.645 --> 01:55:21.645
Rocket.

01:55:21.805 --> 01:55:23.363
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

01:55:26.005 --> 01:55:27.005
Mmm...

01:55:29.805 --> 01:55:32.160
No. I'm not leaving without him.

01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:40.165
I'm sorry.

01:55:40.965 --> 01:55:43.763
I can only afford to lose
one friend today.

01:55:44.325 --> 01:55:45.325
Kraglin, go!

01:55:46.205 --> 01:55:47.205
Wait...

01:55:47.965 --> 01:55:49.523
Is Quill back?

01:55:51.045 --> 01:55:53.479
Rocket, where's Quill?

01:55:54.605 --> 01:55:57.881
Rocket, where's Quill?

01:55:59.045 --> 01:56:00.273
<i>Rocket!</i>

01:56:01.325 --> 01:56:02.325
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

01:56:04.365 --> 01:56:06.276
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

01:56:14.685 --> 01:56:16.835
No, we need to stop it.

01:56:22.005 --> 01:56:23.040
Stop.

01:56:23.845 --> 01:56:25.403
Stop. Listen to me!

01:56:25.605 --> 01:56:27.118
You are a god.

01:56:28.685 --> 01:56:30.038
If you kill me...

01:56:30.205 --> 01:56:32.673
you'll be just like everybody else.

01:56:33.805 --> 01:56:35.443
What's so wrong with that?

01:56:35.605 --> 01:56:36.605
No!

01:57:27.205 --> 01:57:29.355
He may have been your father, boy,

01:57:29.485 --> 01:57:30.918
but he wasn't your daddy.

01:57:35.325 --> 01:57:37.634
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

01:57:38.725 --> 01:57:41.000
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

01:57:44.765 --> 01:57:47.279
What?

01:57:57.885 --> 01:57:59.034
Yondu, what are you doing?

01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:00.320
You can't.

01:58:01.605 --> 01:58:02.605
Yondu!

01:58:08.525 --> 01:58:09.958
No!

01:58:14.565 --> 01:58:15.565
No!

01:58:16.565 --> 01:58:18.157
Oh! Aww...

01:58:18.845 --> 01:58:21.359
No! No!

01:58:22.085 --> 01:58:23.996
Oh, no!

01:59:18.845 --> 01:59:20.324
I told Gamora...

01:59:20.445 --> 01:59:22.356
how when I was a kid I used to pretend

01:59:22.445 --> 01:59:24.242
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

01:59:27.165 --> 01:59:29.759
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

01:59:31.365 --> 01:59:33.162
Earlier, it struck me...

01:59:34.405 --> 01:59:38.523
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

01:59:39.125 --> 01:59:41.400
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...

01:59:41.565 --> 01:59:43.840
but he did have the whistle of one.

01:59:43.925 --> 01:59:47.474
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

01:59:47.565 --> 01:59:50.125
and hooked up with hot women...

01:59:50.285 --> 01:59:52.241
and fought robots.

01:59:54.965 --> 01:59:58.958
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.

01:59:59.125 --> 02:00:00.194
Only it was you, Yondu.

02:00:06.885 --> 02:00:08.762
I had a pretty cool dad.

02:00:11.765 --> 02:00:14.404
What I'm trying to say here is...

02:00:15.405 --> 02:00:20.081
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...

02:00:22.445 --> 02:00:24.754
it's right there by your side all along.

02:00:24.925 --> 02:00:26.722
You don't even know it.

02:00:38.845 --> 02:00:40.278
I am Groot.

02:00:41.685 --> 02:00:43.437
He did call you twig.

02:00:45.885 --> 02:00:47.204
Nebula...

02:00:52.165 --> 02:00:54.121
I was a child like you.

02:00:55.085 --> 02:00:59.158
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

02:00:59.325 --> 02:01:02.283
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

02:01:02.485 --> 02:01:04.203
I'm trying to make it right.

02:01:04.405 --> 02:01:05.804
There are little girls like you...

02:01:05.965 --> 02:01:08.798
across the universe who are in danger.

02:01:11.485 --> 02:01:12.964
You can stay with us and help them.

02:01:13.645 --> 02:01:15.920
I will help them by killing Thanos.

02:01:16.125 --> 02:01:18.161
I don't know if that's possible.

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:35.201
You will always be my sister.

02:02:19.525 --> 02:02:20.525
Pete!

02:02:24.205 --> 02:02:25.957
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

02:02:26.125 --> 02:02:28.958
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

02:02:30.765 --> 02:02:31.880
What is it?

02:02:32.045 --> 02:02:33.045
It's called a Zune.

02:02:33.245 --> 02:02:35.021
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.

02:02:35.045 --> 02:02:36.637
It's got 300 songs on it.

02:02:36.805 --> 02:02:39.080
300 songs?

02:02:44.245 --> 02:02:45.314
Wait.

02:02:51.445 --> 02:02:53.325
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

02:02:53.485 --> 02:02:55.919
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

02:02:59.325 --> 02:03:00.678
Thanks...

02:03:02.525 --> 02:03:03.753
Captain.

02:03:42.845 --> 02:03:45.564
<i>It's not time to make a change</i>

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:50.394
<i>Just relax, take it easy</i>

02:03:50.565 --> 02:03:54.274
<i>You're still young, that's your fault</i>

02:03:54.445 --> 02:03:57.323
<i>There's so much you have to know</i>

02:03:57.485 --> 02:04:01.683
<i>Find a girl, settle down</i>

02:04:01.845 --> 02:04:04.917
<i>If you want you can marry</i>

02:04:05.125 --> 02:04:10.483
<i>Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy</i>

02:04:15.845 --> 02:04:17.164
They came.

02:04:25.165 --> 02:04:26.678
What is it?

02:04:27.325 --> 02:04:29.885
I sent word to
Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

02:04:29.965 --> 02:04:31.398
and told them what he did.

02:04:35.165 --> 02:04:36.883
It's a Ravager funeral.

02:04:54.285 --> 02:04:55.285
Yeah!

02:04:55.885 --> 02:04:57.364
Yeah!

02:05:04.725 --> 02:05:06.556
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

02:05:07.565 --> 02:05:09.317
No, he did not, son.

02:05:10.325 --> 02:05:11.758
He did not.

02:05:18.525 --> 02:05:21.756
Fare thee well, old friend.

02:05:24.205 --> 02:05:28.881
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

02:05:32.965 --> 02:05:34.921
He didn't chase them away.

02:05:35.085 --> 02:05:36.200
No.

02:05:37.245 --> 02:05:39.281
Even though he yelled at them.

02:05:39.445 --> 02:05:40.958
And was always mean.

02:05:43.605 --> 02:05:45.721
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

02:05:51.365 --> 02:05:52.923
Well, of course not.

02:06:17.125 --> 02:06:18.274
What?

02:06:18.965 --> 02:06:20.114
It's just...

02:06:22.805 --> 02:06:25.399
some unspoken thing.

02:06:34.605 --> 02:06:36.641
It's beautiful.

02:06:38.125 --> 02:06:39.319
It is.

02:06:40.845 --> 02:06:42.961
And so are you.

02:06:44.965 --> 02:06:46.193
On the inside.

02:06:53.085 --> 02:06:54.803
<i>Now there's a way</i>

02:06:55.005 --> 02:06:58.964
<i>And I know that I have to go away</i>

02:07:00.685 --> 02:07:03.153
<i>I know I have to go</i>

02:08:42.325 --> 02:08:43.394
You know, it's a shame...

02:08:43.565 --> 02:08:47.922
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

02:08:48.085 --> 02:08:51.282
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

02:08:51.965 --> 02:08:53.000
I'm in.

02:08:53.205 --> 02:08:54.035
Dope.

02:08:54.205 --> 02:08:56.275
I miss you guys so much!

02:08:56.445 --> 02:08:57.639
Hell, yes.

02:09:00.765 --> 02:09:02.676
What say we steal some shit?

02:11:21.885 --> 02:11:23.762
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

02:11:25.045 --> 02:11:28.117
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

02:11:32.805 --> 02:11:35.763
When they see
what I have created here...

02:11:35.925 --> 02:11:37.881
their wrath will dissipate.

02:11:39.165 --> 02:11:42.157
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

02:11:43.565 --> 02:11:44.759
That, my child...

02:11:44.965 --> 02:11:46.762
is the next step in our evolution.

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:50.116
More powerful, more beautiful...

02:11:50.285 --> 02:11:54.324
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

02:11:57.005 --> 02:11:59.439
I think I shall call him...

02:12:01.285 --> 02:12:02.684
Adam.

02:14:04.685 --> 02:14:06.118
Ugh, dude.

02:14:07.085 --> 02:14:08.677
Seriously?

02:14:08.845 --> 02:14:10.845
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

02:14:10.925 --> 02:14:12.324
I am Groot.

02:14:12.525 --> 02:14:14.436
I am not boring. You're boring.

02:14:14.605 --> 02:14:15.435
You know what's boring?

02:14:15.605 --> 02:14:18.756
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

02:14:18.925 --> 02:14:22.520
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

02:14:23.045 --> 02:14:24.273
I'm not boring!

02:14:24.445 --> 02:14:25.445
I am Groot.

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:29.593
And now I know how Yondu felt.

02:15:05.445 --> 02:15:07.640
In these times of hardship...

02:15:08.765 --> 02:15:10.801
just remember...

02:15:11.445 --> 02:15:15.484
We. Are. Groot.

02:15:18.765 --> 02:15:19.959
Hey, fellas.

02:15:20.125 --> 02:15:21.797
Wait, where are you going?

02:15:21.965 --> 02:15:24.320
You were supposed to be my lift home.

02:15:24.485 --> 02:15:26.157
How will I get out of here?

02:15:26.325 --> 02:15:27.644
Hey! Aw, gee...

02:15:27.725 --> 02:15:30.444
I've got so many
more stories to tell.

02:15:30.645 --> 02:15:31.839
Aw, guys.

02:15:32.005 --> 02:15:34.314
Oh, gee...

02:15:37.344 --> 02:15:54.344
