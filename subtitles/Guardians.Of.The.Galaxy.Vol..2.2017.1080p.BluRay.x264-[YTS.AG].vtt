Hey, twig!

01:01:45.565 --> 01:01:46.964
Come here.

01:01:47.445 --> 01:01:48.673
Come on.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:56.245
Aw, man...

01:01:56.445 --> 01:01:57.878
what did they do to you?

01:02:01.005 --> 01:02:03.439
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:07.482
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

01:02:07.645 --> 01:02:11.684
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

01:02:11.885 --> 01:02:13.477
the thing I wore on my head.

01:02:14.205 --> 01:02:18.244
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

01:02:18.445 --> 01:02:19.719
You got it?

01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:54.964
That's my underwears.

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:57.341
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

01:02:57.365 --> 01:02:59.356
You have to explain it more careful.

01:03:00.925 --> 01:03:04.315
It's a prototype fin.

01:03:09.805 --> 01:03:12.558
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

01:03:12.725 --> 01:03:14.317
You explain it this time.

01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:17.004
All right.

01:03:17.845 --> 01:03:19.722
That's Vorker's eye.

01:03:19.885 --> 01:03:21.876
He takes it out when he sleeps.

01:03:22.045 --> 01:03:23.398
Go. Look again.

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:24.964
But leave the eye here.

01:03:25.325 --> 01:03:26.440
Why?

01:03:26.605 --> 01:03:27.958
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

01:03:28.165 --> 01:03:30.520
and he's not gonna know...

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.915
where his eye is!

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.683
That's a desk.

01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:43.558
We told you it was this big.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.720
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:54.604
with a bunch of severed human toes.

01:03:54.765 --> 01:03:58.360
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

01:04:01.645 --> 01:04:05.320
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

01:04:05.485 --> 01:04:06.838
Okay?

01:04:15.365 --> 01:04:17.242
What? No!

01:04:17.405 --> 01:04:18.661
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

01:04:18.685 --> 01:04:20.004
That's not what I said!

01:04:20.165 --> 01:04:21.165
I am Groot.

01:04:21.245 --> 01:04:22.421
He's relieved you don't want him to.

01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:23.924
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

01:04:24.085 --> 01:04:24.756
I am Groot.

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:26.114
On anyone, not just himself.

01:04:26.285 --> 01:04:27.115
I am Groot.

01:04:27.205 --> 01:04:29.261
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

01:04:29.285 --> 01:04:32.141
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

01:04:32.165 --> 01:04:33.439
That's why you don't like hats?

01:04:34.645 --> 01:04:36.920
This is an important conversation
right now?

01:05:13.645 --> 01:05:14.645
That ain't it.

01:05:24.565 --> 01:05:25.998
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

01:05:29.045 --> 01:05:30.876
They killed all my friends.

01:05:34.925 --> 01:05:37.439
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

01:05:44.165 --> 01:05:45.165
One more thing.

01:05:47.005 --> 01:05:49.314
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?
